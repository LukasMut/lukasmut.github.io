# Research Profile

I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at TU Berlin and the Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning and Data (BIFOLD). I am also a guest researcher in the <a href="https://www.cbs.mpg.de/independent-research-groups/vision-and-computational-cognition">ViCCo Group</a> at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences. I am mainly advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jplQac8AAAAJ&hl=en">Klaus-Robert MÃ¼ller</a> and co-supervised by <a href="http://martin-hebart.de/">Martin Hebart</a>. I am also part of a Research Collaboration with <a href="https://research.google/teams/brain/">Google DeepMind</a>, where I am advised by <a href="https://simonster.com//">Simon Kornblith</a>. Previously, I was a MSc student in IT & Cognition / Computer Science of <a href="http://isabelleaugenstein.github.io/">Isabelle Augenstein</a> and <a href="http://bjerva.github.io/"> at the University of Copenhagen where I worked on Question Answering and Machine Translation. 

<p>My research mainly revolves around representation learning. In particular, I work on robust representations and out-of-distribution generalization in low data regimes across different fields. In so doing, I use neural networks, approximate Bayesian methods (such as variational inference) and other approaches from probability theory. Wherever applicable, I additionally draw inspiration from the cognitive sciences. Mostly, however, I am debugging, examining model behaviour, using print statements, and contemplating why things are not working. Have a look at my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ktyApiAAAAAJ&hl=de">Google Scholar</a> for more information about my work and interests. Feel free to reach out to me, if you believe our research intentions are aligned and you are keen to collaborate on a project.</p>
