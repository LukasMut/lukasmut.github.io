# Research Profile

I am a Student Researcher at Google DeepMind and a PhD student in Machine Learning at TU Berlin and the Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning and Data (<a href="https://www.bifold.berlin/">BIFOLD</a>). I am also a guest researcher in the <a href="https://www.cbs.mpg.de/independent-research-groups/vision-and-computational-cognition">ViCCo Group</a> at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences. I am mainly advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jplQac8AAAAJ&hl=en">Klaus-Robert MÃ¼ller</a> and co-supervised by <a href="http://martin-hebart.de/">Martin Hebart</a>. During my PhD, I've been part of a Research Collaboration between TU Berlin and <a href="https://research.google/teams/brain/">Google DeepMind</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://simonster.com//">Simon Kornblith</a>. Previously, I was a MSc student in IT & Cognition / Computer Science of <a href="http://isabelleaugenstein.github.io/">Isabelle Augenstein</a> and <a href="http://bjerva.github.io/">Johannes Bjerva</a> at the University of Copenhagen where I mostly worked on Question Answering and Machine Translation. 

<p>My research mainly revolves around representation learning. In particular, I am trying to both understand the factors that influence the degree of  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.01201.pdf">alignment between human and neural network representations</a> and figure out how we can leverage human inductive biases or insights from cognitive science most fruitfully for (robust) machine learning. Have a look at my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ktyApiAAAAAJ&hl=de">Google Scholar</a> for more information about my work. Feel free to reach out to me, if you believe our research intentions are aligned and you are keen to collaborate on a project.</p>
