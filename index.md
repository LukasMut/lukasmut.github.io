# Research Profile

<p>I am a (full-time) Senior ML Research Scientist at <a href="https://www.aignostics.com/">Aignostics</a> and a (part-time) Senior Researcher in the Explainable Machine Learning Group at TU Munich, working on model merging, representation merging, and post-training approaches in Computer Vision. Prior to that, I was a Student Researcher at <a href="https://deepmind.google/">Google DeepMind</a> and a PhD student in Machine Learning at TU Berlin and the Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning and Data (<a href="https://www.bifold.berlin/">BIFOLD</a>). Throughout most of my PhD I have also been a guest researcher in the <a href="https://www.cbs.mpg.de/independent-research-groups/vision-and-computational-cognition">ViCCo Group</a> at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences. I was mainly advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jplQac8AAAAJ&hl=en">Klaus-Robert MÃ¼ller</a> (TU Berlin) and co-supervised by <a href="http://martin-hebart.de/">Martin Hebart</a> (MPI), <a href="https://simonster.com/">Simon Kornblith</a> (Anthropic), and <a href="https://lampinen.github.io/">Andrew Lampinen</a> (Google DeepMind). During my PhD, I've been part of a one-year Research Collaboration between TU Berlin and <a href="https://research.google/teams/brain/">Google Brain</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://simonster.com//">Simon Kornblith</a>. Previously, I was a MSc student in IT & Cognition / Computer Science of <a href="http://isabelleaugenstein.github.io/">Isabelle Augenstein</a> and <a href="http://bjerva.github.io/">Johannes Bjerva</a> at the University of Copenhagen where I mostly worked on Question Answering and Machine Translation.</p>

<p>My research mainly revolves around representation learning in computer vision. In particular, I try to understand the factors that influence the degree of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.01201.pdf">alignment between human mental and neural network representations</a> and use inspiration from human cognition to <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/9febda1c8344cc5f2d51713964864e93-Abstract-Conference.html">improve deep learning models</a>. My goal is to build interpretable (vision) foundation models that generalize to downstream out-of-distribution settings (similar to how the human brain does); something that we partly achieved <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06509">here</a>.</p> 

<p>Occasionally I dabble in philosophical discussions about <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.13018">representational alignment</a> and try to develop common language across research disciplines together with other people in the field. Recently, I've been thinking a lot about the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05561">transferability of representational similarities across datasets</a>. Have a look at my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ktyApiAAAAAJ&hl=de">Google Scholar</a> for more information about my work. Feel free to reach out to me, if you believe our research intentions are aligned (pun intended) and you are keen to collaborate on a project.</p>
