							<h3>Contagious times: a letter of hope</h3>
							
							<p>Covid-19 is highly contagious. That’s a given fact. All of us know about it. We need to self-isolate, practice social distancing, be more hygienic and cautious than ever before. Whoever has doubts about the latter is very much denying reality. 
							There is, however, something else that’s utterly contagious. Thoughts. Although the vast majority of us is currently spending most of our times at home, not seeing any of our beloved ones, we exchange thoughts, fears, perspectives about the world more frequently than usually. 
							Any emotion, any thought, any view is, as we know from neuroscience, contagious. The latter holds even more so for times full of uncertainty, times such as these. We make predictions about post-corona times. 
							We estimate the likelihood not only of how long the current situation will last, but also of humanities’ behaviour after the pandemic. 
							Currently, we are forced into a life centred around minimalism. Consumption, flying, partying, eating out - among many other recreational activities - are put on hold. 
							We must live as if the possibility of moving across borders, living a life outside of home does not exist. Although this is reality, it sounds and indeed feels surreal. The situation is one that is utterly new. 
							I for myself have never experienced anything similar, and I suppose most of you did not either.</p>
							
							<p>With it comes one question we have to reflect upon: Is it at all that bad? Let’s try to perceive the positive side-effects of all of this. There is one big beneficiary. The environment. Never before did humanity and animal kingdom inhale such fresh air. 
							Never before have waterways across Europe been that clean. Never before have CO2 emissions across the globe been that low.</p>
							
							<p>I hear people having conversations about potential *rebound effects*. That is, that after the crisis humanity will go back to the state before the crisis or a life with even higher consumption and travel rates, without integrating anything into their (future) daily lives that humanity is currently forced to practice.
							I doubt it. I am not that pessimistic. Recall that thoughts, fears, and views about the world are contagious. 
							If we frequently tell ourselves and others that a rebound effect will happen, and humanity won’t learn anything at all, the odds are in fact high that this will happen. This is called nothing other than a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, if we trust in humans’ ability to change, flip the coin and rather believe that our brains, lazy as they are, will get used to lives without mass consumption, 
							without enormous travel rates, simply lives with less, chances are high that post-corona times will be brighter than pre-corona times.</p>
							
							<p>I as someone who believes in nothing but the evidence have hope. Hope, one of the mightiest thoughts, is contagious. Perhaps, hope is more contagious than Covid-19. There’s one huge difference though between hope and Covid-19: influence. 
							We cannot exert an influence on how contagious Covid-19 is on our immune system, but we can most definitely influence how contagious hope is on our collective brain system. 
							It’s darn simple: we just need to share it. 
							If we all believe in the possibility that we will take away many of corona’s lessons, and grasp the opportunity to finally make a change, the rebound effect will become out of sight. 
							Sure, many of us will go back to “normal” after the crisis. It’s not about the many though. It’s about the few who infect each other with positivity and thoughtfulness, who believe in a life that embraces minimalism rather than profligacy.</p>

							<h3>Are accuracy scores and SOTA all we care about?</h3>
							
							<p>If one takes a glance at the leaderboards in the realms of Computer Vision and NLP (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE, WikiSQL), 
								then one can quickly infer that high accuracies (or F1 scores) are paramount to the field. Not only leaderboards, 
								also the content and tone of accepted papers at major academic venues indicate that state-of-the-art (SOTA) results 
								are what conferences and journals care most about. I get and suppose, that we should always aim at building more accurately 
								performing systems. However, shouldn’t academia ALSO be about the methodology and creativity, or the intention (e.g., curing a disease, 
								supporting the fight against climate change) behind an algorithmic approach? Universities that are not named MIT, CMU, Stanford, Harvard, Toronto, 
								Oxbridge, etc., can barely keep up with the tech industry in the (fast-paced) development of best performing systems, mainly due to a lack of money and resources, 
								and not a shortage of brains or creative thinking. To train bigger neural networks, one needs access to dozens of strong GPUs or TPUs. 
								Without money, that’s rather a daunting endeavour. I strongly believe, that we as a field, and academia in general should aim at collaboration 
								across the board (especially with universities that don’t have the money and resources to stay in the game), highlight work that got accepted even without having 
								achieved SOTA results or access to the strongest GPUs, underline the grueling work reseachers have been through to write paper X, support the small and unseen. 
								Academia should not become just a profit or SOTA oriented business. I know, we shall collaborate tightly with industry, which is definitely not a bad thing at all 
								(I am actually an advocate of the latter), but let’s reflect again upon the core values of science, which are, as far as I am concerned, creativity, out-of-the-box thinking, 
								rigorous methodology, problem-solving, and in particular collaboration.</p>
