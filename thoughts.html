							<h3>Are accuracy scores and SOTA all we care about?</h3>
							
							<p>If one takes a glance at the leaderboards in the realms of Computer Vision and NLP (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE, WikiSQL), 
								then one can quickly infer that high accuracies (or F1 scores) are paramount to the field. Not only leaderboards, 
								also the content and tone of accepted papers at major academic venues indicate that state-of-the-art (SOTA) results 
								are what conferences and journals care most about. I get and suppose, that we should always aim at building more accurately 
								performing systems. However, shouldn’t academia ALSO be about the methodology and creativity, or the intention (e.g., curing a disease, 
								supporting the fight against climate change) behind an algorithmic approach? Universities that are not named MIT, CMU, Stanford, Harvard, Toronto, 
								Oxbridge, etc., can barely keep up with the tech industry in the (fast-paced) development of best performing systems, mainly due to a lack of money and resources, 
								and not a shortage of brains or creative thinking. To train bigger neural networks, one needs access to dozens of strong GPUs or TPUs. 
								Without money, that’s rather a daunting endeavour. I strongly believe, that we as a field, and academia in general should aim at collaboration 
								across the board (especially with universities that don’t have the money and resources to stay in the game), highlight work that got accepted even without having 
								achieved SOTA results or access to the strongest GPUs, underline the grueling work reseachers have been through to write paper X, support the small and unseen. 
								Academia should not become just a profit or SOTA oriented business. I know, we shall collaborate tightly with industry, which is definitely not a bad thing at all 
								(I am actually an advocate of the latter), but let’s reflect again upon the core values of science, which are, as far as I am concerned, creativity, out-of-the-box thinking, 
								rigorous methodology, problem-solving, and particularly collaboration.</p>
